# Secret Santa (Couples-aware)

A small app that builds a list of participants (couples + singles) and
computes a Secret Santa assignment where:
- nobody gets themselves
- people in the same couple cannot draw each other
- a history of previous years is taken into account to avoid repeats
- a super secret mode where not even the organizer knows who is assigned to whom

## Run

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

# Sending emails

`cp .env.example .env` and fill in your SMTP details.

Run the app, enter names and emails, draw the pairs via "Itâ€™s our little secret", then click "Send emails".

Each giver receives **one email**:

---
**Subject:** Secret Santa

**Body:** includes the name of their assigned recipient.

---

Fancy to customize the email content? Edit the 'body' variable in `secretsanta/services/emailer.py`. 

> Make sure to keep `{giver}` and `{recipient}` in the body, as they will be replaced with the actual names!!!
